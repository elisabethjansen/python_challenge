## PyBank

This assignment was completed indivdually using the following resources to guide my code and aid in debugging: 

Lines 28-29 - Xpert Learning Assistant to help debug issue with error associated with the int function
Lines 33-34 & 39-40 - Xpert Learning Assistant to help the syntax of adding items to my dictionary, and calling them for analysis and print out.
Line 46 - Stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5202233/how-to-change-39-54484700000000-to-39-54-and-using-python) to help with the decimal adjustment
Lines 51-59 - Stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7152762/how-to-redirect-print-output-to-a-file) and Stanford Resources (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/py/python-print.html) to help with writing output info to a new file using "file = xx"

Code for this project can be found within the PyBank folder as main.py
Analysis of the csv file using the code in main.py can be found as a .txt file in the analysis folder

## PyPoll

This assignment was completed indivdually using the following resources to guide my code and aid in debugging: 

Line 40 - Stack overflow for syntax related decimals (see link above)
Lines 31-32 - Xpert Learning assistant to help guide the consolidation of variables through correctly calling data within my dictionaries
Lines 45-49 - Stanford Resources to help writing the output info to a new file and add to correct folder (see link above)

Entirety of project -- reffered to the previous exercise and class examples to structure code and guide correct syntax

Code for this project can be found within the PyPoll folder as main.py
Analysis of the csv file using the code in main.py can be found as a .txt file in the analysis folder
